Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1.  For the Scrabble game, we recommended using arrays for the rack and the
board, but ArrayList for the bag.  Why? Compare the strengths and weaknesses of arrays vs ArrayLists.
Because you're constantly changing the size of a bag so an ArrayList is more appropriate to use.  The board had to be 2D so used a 2D array as an arrayList can't be 2D.

2. There are many different ways that you could have done the checking for a
valid play in the scrabble game (ie, checking that the working tiles were in a
row or column with no gaps and connected to the previous tiles).  What would be a good way of going about the design of a tricky method like this?
I didn't even get up to this part in the assignment so unfortunately I have no idea sorry. 

3. Last week you constructed a list of the key Java programming
constructs that you used.  Add the important new constructs you used
this week to that list, with a very brief note about each one.
2D Arrays - With this you typically use nester loops to process each item in the two different indicies this array type.
ArrayLists - These can grow/shrink and are a class in libraries.
Arrays - Have a fixed size and are built into java. It is an objct with a sequence of places. 


4. If you learned any more important concepts about programming or Computer
Recursion is when a method calls upon itself and if you want to get out of the method you have to place a statment in which, when true, it gets returned out from the method.
Science, add them to your list from last week.
