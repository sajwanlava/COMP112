 * The GUIExercise program is a very simple program that lets the user place 
 *  images on the graphics pane using the mouse.
 * It has a Clear button, and a text field to enter the name of the image
 * The Clear button should clear the graphics pane.
 * If the user enters a name into the text field, it should store the value
 *  in a field.
 * When the user releases the mouse at any point on the canvas, the program
 *  should draw the image that the user specified at that point (note, if
 *  there is no image file of the given name, it may not draw anything).
