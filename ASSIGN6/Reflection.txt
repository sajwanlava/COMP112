Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1. Briefly list the features that you implemented in your Chat Client.
- Connecting to a server
- Logging into a server
- Leaving a server
- Kind of joined a channel


2. Describe how you tested your program, and discuss how much confidence you have
that your testing shows that the program works correctly. 
I can confidently say that I have no confidence in anything I do. I tried to print some information, but I didn't get through much at all so wasn't able to test thoroughly.
